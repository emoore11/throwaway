# Throwaway Repo

Add a new feature to the throwaway repo to practice git.
Making a few more changes to my code.
I love making changes to my code.

* To commit changes, use " git commit -m "and then use a detailed but brief message to describe your changes
* Once you've committed your changes, do git status to make sure your changes have been committed.
*After you have done this, you will go to git hub for your next steps.
* I'm making more changes to my code here.
* Remember that you always have to save here before going back to terminal (at least until you figure out how).

This is another sentence about code, and the importance of commit messages.

Oops, I might have made a mistake by trying to do git -a before I was ready *eye roll* I guess we'll see.

Well I'm still alive, so I guess it didn't mess up too much. :D
