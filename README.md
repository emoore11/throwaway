# Throwaway Repo

Add a new feature to the throwaway repo to practice git.
Making a few more changes to my code.
I love making changes to my code.

* To commit changes, use " git commit -m "and then use a detailed but brief message to describe your changes
* Once you've committed your changes, do git status to make sure your changes have been committed.
*After you have done this, you will go to git hub for your next steps.
* I'm making more changes to my code here.
